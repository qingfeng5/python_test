The Zen of Python by Tim Peters
Beautiful is better than ugly
Explicit is better than implicit
Simple is better than complex
Complex is better than complicated
Flat is better than nested
Sparse is better than dense
Readability counts
Special cases are not special enough to break the rules
Although practicality beats purity
Errors should never pass silently
Unless explicitly silenced
In the face of ambiguity
refuse the temptation to guess
There should be one
and preferably only one 
obvious way to do it
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you are Dutch
Now is better than never
Although never is often better than right now
If the implementation is hard to explain
it is a bad idea
If the implementation is easy to explain
it may be a good idea
Namespaces are one honking great idea
let us do more of those
Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively
You can learn to use Python and see almost immediate gains in productivity and lower maintenance costs
Python is easy to learn and use
Python is powrful
I think you will enjoy it
